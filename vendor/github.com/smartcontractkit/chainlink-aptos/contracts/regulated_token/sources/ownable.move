/// This module implements an Ownable component similar to Ownable2Step.sol for managing
/// object ownership.
///
/// Due to Aptos's security model requiring the original owner's signer for 0x1::object::transfer,
/// this implementation uses a 3-step ownership transfer flow:
///
/// 1. Initial owner calls transfer_ownership with the new owner's address
/// 2. Pending owner calls accept_ownership to confirm the transfer
/// 3. Initial owner calls execute_ownership_transfer to complete the transfer
///
/// The execute_ownership_transfer function requires a signer in order to perform the
/// object transfer, while other operations only require the caller address to maintain the
/// principle of least privilege.
///
/// Note that direct ownership transfers via 0x1::object::transfer are still possible.
/// This module handles such cases gracefully by reading the current owner directly
/// from the object.
